## GitHub Actions Workflow: Publish to PyPI/TestPyPI
## - Triggers:
##   - Release published: publishes the project to the configured PyPI repository.
##   - Manual (workflow_dispatch): publishes to the specified repository input (pypi or testpypi).
## - Behavior:
##   - Sets up Python and PDM, builds the distribution with PDM, then runs `pdm publish`.
##   - Uses OIDC (id-token: write) for Trusted Publisher authentication (PEP 740).
##     Ensure the repository is configured as a Trusted Publisher on PyPI/TestPyPI.
## - Note:
##   - This workflow rebuilds before publishing. If you prefer publishing the exact artifact
##     built in the build workflow, adjust this to download and reuse that wheel instead.
